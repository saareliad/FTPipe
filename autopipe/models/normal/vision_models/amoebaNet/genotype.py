# According to the paper for AmoebaNet-D, 'normal_concat' should be [4, 5, 6]
# just like 'reduce_concat'. But 'normal_concat' in the reference AmoebaNet-D
# implementation by TensorFlow is defined as [0, 3, 4, 6], which is different
# with the paper.
#
# For now, we couldn't be sure which is correct. But the GPipe paper seems to
# rely on the setting of TensorFlow's implementation. With this, we can
# reproduce the size of model parameters reported at Table 1 in the paper,
# exactly.
